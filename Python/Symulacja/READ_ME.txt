This program is supposed to simulate the motion of the charged particle in the magnetic and electric fields. To estimate the particle's trajectory, it uses the Runge-Kutta Method of 4th Order.
In order to start the program, the "main.py" file needs to be compiled. Compilation results in the opening of a GUI window which will ask you to fill all the blanks and press the "Start Simulation" button in order to begin calculating and displaying the results. 
In order to stop the program, the "Stop Simulation" button is implemented. 
Results can be saved using the "Save Plot" button. 
Example starting parameters: Q=1, B=1, q=-1, m=1, vx=1, vy=1.
Pressing "Start Simulation" button after "Stop Simulation" button resets the simulations and starts new one.
The simulation has unresolved issues that render it inconsistent with physical predictions.
